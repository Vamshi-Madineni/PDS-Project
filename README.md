# Project Overview
The SHEMS database serves as a central repository deployed by energy providers, allowing homeowners to connect and gain insights into their energy consumption patterns. Through this system, users can access past energy usage and cost data, understand the impact of various appliances and settings, and optimize their energy consumption. 

# Web Based UI using Flask for SHEMS 
The platform provides users with the capability to register and log in. Users can manage their service locations and smart devices by listing, adding, and removing them. When adding a new smart device, users can choose the device type and select from a predefined list of models associated with that device type. Furthermore, the system offers users multiple perspectives on their energy consumption patterns.
